## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
#Testing Sample Means: One Sample Z and T Tests
```{r}
library(curl)
f <- curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fuzzyatelin/fuzzyatelin.github.io/master/AN597_Fall17/vervet-weights.csv")
d <- read.csv(f, header = TRUE, sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(d)
```
```{r}
mean(d$weight)
```
Ho is that the mean is equal to 4.9
Ha is the mean is greater than 4.9
This is a upper-tailed test
lets now test the mean, sd and SEM of the sample
```{r}
mu <- 4.9
x <- d$weight
m <- mean(x)
m
s <- sd(x)
s
n <- length(x)
sem <- s/sqrt(n)
sem
```
above are the mean, sd ad sem
```{r}
z <- (m - mu)/sem
z
```
this is our z score, it is the estimated number of standard errors of the mean away from the population mean that our sample falls
```{r}
p <- 1 - pnorm(z)
p
```
this is ouur p value
```{r}
p <- pnorm(z, lower.tail = FALSE)
p
```
we use this because we want the upper part not the lower
becasue our sample is limmited, we will use the t distrabution
```{r}
p <- 1 - pt(z, df = n - 1)
p
```
this is the p value for t disrtabution
```{r}
p <- pt(z, df = n - 1, lower.tail = FALSE)
p
```
```{r}
t <- t.test(x = x, mu = mu, alternative = "greater")
t
```
this means we reject the Ho and the mean is differnt this year.
```{r}
lower <- m - qt(1 - 0.05/2, df = n - 1) * sem
upper <- m + qt(1 - 0.05/2, df = n - 1) * sem
ci <- c(lower, upper)
ci
```
this is calulating the CI bby hand
```{r}
t <- t.test(x = x, mu = mu, alternative = "two.sided")
ci <- t$conf.int
ci
```
this iscalculating the CI with R built in functions


For this question about woolly monkeys, Ho is the mean weight is 7.2kg and Ha is the mean weight is not 7.2kg
```{r}
f <- curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fuzzyatelin/fuzzyatelin.github.io/master/AN597_Fall17/woolly-weights.csv")
d <- read.csv(f, header = TRUE, sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(d)
```
```{r}
x <- d$weight
m <- mean(x)
s <- sd(x)
n <- length(x)
sem <- s/sqrt(n)
mu <- 7.2
t <- (m - mu)/sem
t
```
here ge got our t statistic by hand
```{r}
alpha <- 0.05
crit <- qt(1 - alpha/2, df = n - 1)  # identify critical values
test <- t < -crit || t > crit  # boolean test as two whether t is larger than the critical value at either tail
test <- abs(t) > crit
t.test(x = x, mu = mu, alternative = "two.sided")
```
here we got our T test using the built in t-tester in R
here we reject Ho
#Comparing Sample Means: Two Sample Z and T Tests
```{r}
f <- curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fuzzyatelin/fuzzyatelin.github.io/master/AN597_Fall17/colobus-weights.csv")
d <- read.csv(f, header = TRUE, sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(d)
```
```{r}
x <- d$weight[d$sex == "male"]
y <- d$weight[d$sex == "female"]
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
boxplot(x, ylim = c(4.5, 8), main = "Weight (kg)", xlab = "Males")
boxplot(y, ylim = c(4.5, 8), main = "Weight (kg)", xlab = "Females")
```
```{r}
m1 <- mean(x)
m2 <- mean(y)
mu <- 0  # you could leave this out... the default argument value is 0
s1 <- sd(x)
s2 <- sd(y)
n1 <- length(x)
n2 <- length(y)
```
```{r}
t <- (m2 - m1 - mu)/sqrt(s2^2/n2 + s1^2/n1)
t
```
here is our t statistic
```{r}
alpha <- 0.05
crit <- qt(1 - alpha/2, df = n - 1)  # identify critical values
crit
```
this is the critical value
```{r}
test <- t < -crit || t > crit  # boolean test
test <- abs(t) > crit
test
```
```{r}
df <- (s2^2/n2 + s1^2/n1)^2/((s2^2/n2)^2/(n2 - 1) + (s1^2/n1)^2/(n1 - 1))
df
```
calculating df is differnt here
```{r}
t <- t.test(x = x, y = y, mu = 0, alternative = "two.sided")
t
```
here we use the t-test built in function
here we reject Ho becaue 0 is not in the CI
#Samples with Equal Variances
```{r}
s <- sqrt((((n1 - 1) * s1^2) + ((n2 - 1) * s2^2))/(n1 + n2 - 2))
t <- (m2 - m1 - mu)/(sqrt(s^2 * (1/n1 + 1/n2)))
t
```
this is our t-statistic
```{r}
df <- n1 + n2 - 2
df
```
this is the df
```{r}
t <- t.test(x = x, y = y, mu = 0, var.equal = TRUE, alternative = "two.sided")
t
```
```{r}
var(x)/var(y)
```
beacuse this ratio is greater than 2 we must use a F test to see in our var are equale or not
```{r}
vt <- var.test(x, y)
vt
```
hreject Ho, var1 not = to var2
#Paired Samples
```{r}
f <- curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fuzzyatelin/fuzzyatelin.github.io/master/AN597_Fall17/iqs.csv")
d <- read.csv(f, header = TRUE, sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(d)
```
```{r}
x <- d$IQ.before - d$IQ.after
m <- mean(x)
mu <- 0  # can leave this out
s <- sd(x)
n <- length(x)
sem <- s/sqrt(n)
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
boxplot(d$IQ.before, ylim = c(115, 145), main = "IQ", xlab = "Before")
boxplot(d$IQ.after, ylim = c(115, 145), main = "IQ", xlab = "After")
```
```{r}
t <- (m - mu)/sem
t
```
```{r}
alpha <- 0.05
crit <- qt(1 - alpha/2, df = n - 1)  # identify critical values
crit
```
```{r}
test <- t < -crit || t > crit  # boolean test
test
```
here we calculated the t test by hand and Ho is rejected
```{r}
t.test(x, df = n - 1, alternative = "two.sided")
```
here we dd the T test in R and Ho is rejected
#Testing Sample Proportions: One Sample Z Test
```{r}
pop <- c(rep(0, 500), rep(1, 500))
```
here we created a population of 500 1s and 500 0s
```{r}
pi <- 0.5
x <- NULL
n <- 10
for (i in 1:1000) {
    x[i] <- mean(sample(pop, size = n, replace = FALSE))  # taking the mean of a bunch of 0s and 1s yields the proportion of 1s!
}
m <- mean(x)
m
```
this is the population mean
```{r}
s <- sd(x)
s
```
this is the population sd
```{r}
pop_se <- sqrt(pi * (1 - pi)/n)
pop_se
```
this is the population se
```{r}
pop <- c(rep(0, 800), rep(1, 200))
pi <- 0.8
x <- NULL
n <- 10
for (i in 1:1000) {
    x[i] <- mean(sample(pop, size = n, replace = FALSE))  # taking the mean of a bunch of 0s and 1s yields the proportion of 1s!
}
m <- mean(x)
m
```
here we created a population with 800 1s and 200 0s, and apove is the pop mean
```{r}
s <- sd(x)
s
```
this is pop sd
```{r}
pop_se <- sqrt(pi * (1 - pi)/n)
pop_se
```
this is pop se

#challenge for neotropical ornithologist
Ho is p is equal to 80%
Ha is p is less than 80%
```{r}
30*.8
30*(1-.8)
```
both are greater than 5 so we may continue
```{r}
v <- c(0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 
    1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1)
```
these are the results
```{r}
phat <- mean(v)
phat
```
this is the test statistic
```{r}
pi <- 0.8
n <- 30
z <- (phat - pi)/sqrt(pi * (1 - pi)/30)
z
```
this is the z value
```{r}
p <- pnorm(z, lower.tail = TRUE)
p
```
```{r}
lower <- phat - qnorm(0.975) * sqrt(phat * (1 - phat)/30)
upper <- phat + qnorm(0.975) * sqrt(phat * (1 - phat)/30)
ci <- c(lower, upper)
ci
```
this is the CI
from this data we reject Ho becasue pi is not in the CI
```{r}
pt <- prop.test(x = sum(v), n = length(v), p = 0.8, conf.level = 0.95, correct = FALSE, 
    alternative = "less")
pt
```
we use the built in R function and get the same result
#Comparing Sample Proportions: Two Sample Z Tests
testing bats challange
```{r}
v1 <- c(1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 
    1, 0)
v2 <- c(1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 
    0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1)
```
Ho is mean1-mean2=0, Ha is mean1-mean2 does not = 0
```{r}
pstar <- (sum(v1) + sum(v2))/(length(v1) + length(v2))
pstar
```
```{r}
phat1 <- mean(v1)
phat1
```
test statistic for v1
```{r}
phat2 <- mean(v2)
phat2
```
test statistic for v2
```{r}
pi <- 0
z <- (phat2 - phat1)/sqrt((pstar * (1 - pstar)) * (1/length(v1) + 1/length(v2)))
z
```
this is the z avalue
```{r}
p <- 1 - pnorm(z, lower.tail = TRUE) + pnorm(z, lower.tail = FALSE)
p
```
```{r}
crit <- qnorm(1 - alpha/2)  # identify critical values
crit
```
this gives the critical value
```{r}
test <- p < -crit || p > crit  # boolean test
test
```
```{r}
pt <- prop.test(x = c(sum(v2), sum(v1)), n = c(length(v2), length(v1)), alternative = "two.sided", 
    correct = FALSE)
pt
```
I think these results mean that v1 and v2 are equal to eachother b/c 0 is in the CI so do not reject Ho
